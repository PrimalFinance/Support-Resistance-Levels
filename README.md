# Support & Resistance Levels

This program will dynamically create support and resistance levels based on the candles retrieved from Yahoo Finance.

#### Support Levels (green)

- Support level refers to a price level where the price of an asset tends to find buying interest, preventing it from falling further.
- It acts as a "floor" for the price, as there is typically increased demand for the asset when its price approaches this level.
- Traders often see support levels as opportunities to buy or accumulate the asset, expecting it to rebound from that level.

#### Resistance Levels (red)

- Resistance level refers to a price level where the price of an asset tends to encounter selling interest, preventing it from rising further.
- It acts as a "ceiling" for the price, as there is typically increased supply of the asset when its price approaches this level.
- Traders often see resistance levels as opportunities to sell or take profits, expecting the price to reverse or stall around that level.
